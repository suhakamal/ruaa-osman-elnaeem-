<h2>about beethoven</h2>
<img src="beethoven.jpg" alt="beethoven photo" width="250px" height="250px" >
<p>baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and
   pianist.
   Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of
   Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical
   music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to
   the Romantic era in classical music.
    His career has conventionally
   been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period,
   during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have
   lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period
   showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn
   and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as
   heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf.
   In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations
   in musical form and expression.

<h2>his family and childhood</h2>
<p>Beethoven was the grandson of Ludwig van Beethoven (1712–1773);
  a musician from the town of Mechelen in the Austrian Duchy of Brabant
 (in what is now the Flemish region of Belgium) who had moved to Bonn at
  the age of 21. Ludwig was employed as a bass singer at the court of Clemens
 August, Archbishop-Elector of Cologne, eventually rising to become,
 in 1761, Kapellmeister (music director) and hence a pre-eminent musician
 in Bonn. The portrait he commissioned of himself towards the end of his
 life remained displayed in his grandson's rooms as a talisman of his musical
 heritage. Ludwig had one son, Johann (1740–1792), who worked as a tenor in
 the same musical establishment and gave keyboard and violin lessons to
supplement his income.

<h2>his death</h2>
<p>On his return journey to Vienna from Gneixendorf in December 1826,
   illness struck Beethoven again. He was attended until his death by
   Dr. Andreas Wawruch, who throughout December noticed symptoms including
   fever, jaundice and dropsy, with swollen limbs, coughing and breathing
   difficulties. Several operations were carried out to tap off the
   excess fluid from Beethoven's abdomen.
   Karl stayed by Beethoven's bedside during December, but left after the
   beginning of January to join the army at Iglau and did not see his uncle
   again, although he wrote to him shortly afterwards "My dear father ...
   I am living in contentment and regret only that I am separated from you.
   " Immediately following Karl's departure, Beethoven wrote a will making
   his nephew his sole heir. Later in January, Beethoven was attended by
   Dr. Malfatti, whose treatment (recognizing the seriousness of his
   patient's condition) was largely centred on alcohol. As the news spread of
   the severity of Beethoven's condition, many old friends came to visit,
   including Diabelli, Schuppanzigh, Lichnowsky, Schindler, the composer
   Johann Nepomuk Hummel and his pupil Ferdinand Hiller </p>

<h2>Für Elise</h2>
<p>Bagatelle No. 25 in A minor  for solo piano, commonly
  known as "Für Elise" , is one
  of Ludwig van Beethoven's most popular compositions. It was not
  published during his lifetime, only being discovered (by Ludwig Nohl)
  40 years after his death, and may be termed either a Bagatelle or an
  Albumblatt. The identity of "Elise" is unknown; researchers have suggested
  Therese Malfatti, Elisabeth Röckel, or Elise Barensfeld. </p>

  <h2>The Symphony No. 5</h2>
<p>The Symphony No. 5 in C minor of Ludwig van Beethoven, Op. 67, was written
   between 1804 and 1808. It is one of the best-known compositions in
   classical music and one of the most frequently played symphonies,
    and it is widely considered one of the cornerstones of western music.
     First performed in Vienna's Theater an der Wien in 1808, the work
     achieved its prodigious reputation soon afterward. E. T. A. Hoffmann
     described the symphony as "one of the most important works of the
      time". As is typical of symphonies during the Classical period,
       Beethoven's Fifth Symphony has four movements.
It begins with a distinctive four-note "short-short-short-long"</p>

<h2>The Symphony No. 9</h2>
<p>The Symphony No. 9 in D minor, Op. 125, is a choral symphony, the final
   complete symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, composed between 1822 and 1824.
   It was first performed in Vienna on 7 May 1824. The symphony is
   regarded by many critics and musicologists as Beethoven's greatest
   work and one of the supreme achievements in the history of music.
    One of the best-known works in common practice music,it stands as
    one of the most frequently performed symphonies in the world.
    The Ninth was the first example of a major composer using voices in a
    symphony. The final (4th) movement of the symphony features four
    vocal soloists and a chorus. The text was adapted from the "Ode to Joy"
    , a poem written by Friedrich Schiller in 1785 and revised in 1803, with
     additional text written by Beethoven.
    In 2001, Beethoven's original, hand-written manuscript of the score,
    held by the Berlin State Library, was added to the Memory of the World
    Programme Heritage list established by the United Nations, becoming
    the first musical score so designated.</p>
